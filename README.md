# Magic8Ball
This project has three variations of magic 8 balls made in C#. One uses the console with text only. The second one is an alternate version of the 8 ball, but the difference is that the 8 ball is replaced by a mysterious seer who gives his own strange answers. The last one is a standard 8 ball but with a GUI for easier use.
